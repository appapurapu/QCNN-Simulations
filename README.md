# Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)

This repository contains an implementation of a **Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)**. The QCNN architecture is designed to integrate principles of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with quantum computing techniques. The goal of this hybrid architecture is to solve machine learning problems more efficiently by utilizing quantum principles.

## Overview

- **Author**: Raja Appapurapu, PhD Student, Dept. Of Computer Science, Georgia State University
- **Project Name**: QCNN - Quantum Convolutional Neural Network
- **Objective**: Implement and simulate QCNNs for machine learning tasks like image classification, specifically on the MNIST dataset.

## Key Features

- **QCNN Architecture**: Combines quantum-inspired noise with CNN layers to enhance performance.
- **Classical CNN for Comparison**: Simulates the classical CNN alongside QCNN to evaluate the effectiveness of the quantum elements.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Classifies images of handwritten digits using both QCNN and classical CNN.
